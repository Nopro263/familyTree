# Family viewer

This project aims to provide a appealing visualisation for a persons family tree in the web.
Hover over the plus-sign in the lower-right corner to reveal the two tools to use.
- Create a new person
- Connection tool:
  - select the pen and click two people to add a relationship between them
  - select a person and a relationship to add the person as a child in this relation
  
It will also be extended in the future, to allow the selection of subtrees and/or a backend for big trees. (Although this will probably not be in high seas)
